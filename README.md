🌟 Unlocking the Power of NLP with My Latest Project! 🌟

Have you ever wondered how machines can understand if two questions mean the same thing? That’s exactly what I’ve been working on! After completing my journey into Natural Language Processing (NLP), I applied my learning to an exciting project: Quora Question Pairs.

✨ What the Project Does:
🔍 Determines if two questions are semantically similar using advanced NLP techniques.
🖥 Built an interactive Streamlit web app where users can enter two questions and get instant similarity predictions.
📊 Leverages preprocessing, tokenization, length-based features, fuzzy matching, and Bag of Words for robust analysis.

🎯 The Inspiration:
This project draws from a famous Quora competition where the challenge was to detect duplicate questions using subjective, human-labeled data. It’s a fascinating mix of data science and linguistics! I’ve expanded it further by adding custom features to improve accuracy and usability.

🛠 Tech Stack in Action:

Python for core functionality
Streamlit for a user-friendly interface
FuzzyWuzzy and Distance for similarity scoring
BeautifulSoup for preprocessing text
sklearn for predictive modeling
💡 Why NLP?
Natural Language Processing is shaping the way we interact with technology—from chatbots to search engines. Working on this project gave me an opportunity to understand how language can be quantified, analyzed, and interpreted by machines.
